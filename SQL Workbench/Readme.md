-- Implementaton of SQL Queries:

-- 1. Avoid * in SELECT statement. Give the name of columns which you require.

-- 2. Choose appropriate Data Type. E.g. To store strings use varchar in place of text data type. Use text data type, whenever you need to store large data (more than 8000 characters).

-- 3. Avoid nchar and nvarchar if possible since both the data types takes just double memory as char and varchar.

-- 4. Create Clustered and Non-Clustered Indexes.

-- 5. Use joins instead of sub-queries.

-- 6. Use Schema name before SQL objects name.

-- 7. Use Stored Procedure for frequently used data and more complex queries.
